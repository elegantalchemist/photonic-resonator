Work in Progress

A self-blinking matrix of LEDS forming a 'supercomputer' which can calculate whatever you feel like. No computation, programming, coding or SOC or anything else needed - entirely 'electromechanical' in function.

## Materials
* ** Smoked perspex front/diffuser - Frosted Grey S2 9T21 Perspex Acrylic ''Frost Stone Grey'' or equivalent, has a 38% light transmission so fairly heavy diffusion. Cut to 315w x 111h - see dimensions in the CDR schematic file if you wanted to alter this size.
* ** Modular PCB - all files included here for you to have this produced, I used JLCPCB including SMD assembly service for the resistors/diodes on the back. This PCB can be stacked if you so desire, it has output pads to make this super easy. Arranged for though-hole LEDs.
* ** Baffle plate to stop light leakage between LEDs - important and also allows different shapes. All the 3d printing files are enclosed here as STL files.
* ** 5mm Self-blinking through hole LEDs. These are 0.5Hz (one blink every 2 seconds) and are in red (625nm) and orange (600nm) with a forward voltage of 3-3.5V and 20mA power draw. The board has individual SMD resistors at 160 ohm to provide slightly less than operating specs to maximise lifespan, plus 3 diode options to supply even less voltage for less brightness. Ths both allows for selectable brightness as well as maximal lifespan.
* ** LED Sourcing I ordered in bulk from Alibaba see here - various colour options as well as different speeds but a hefty minimum order number [Alibaba JSTronic](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Jstronic-0-5Hz-1-5Hz-2Hz_60724851074.html) but they can also be found in smaller quantities on eBay as self-blinking 5mm LEDs.
